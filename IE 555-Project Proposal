Project Title
Feeding the Future: An Exploratory Analysis of Worldwide Food Production and Consumption

Data Sources

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production

This dataset from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations provides insight into worldwide food production and consumption, focusing on a 
comparison between food produced for human consumption and feed produced for animals.


Analysis Plan
The analysis plan involves identifying interesting outliers in the data, determining the fastest growing countries in terms of food production and consumption, and 
comparing food and feed consumption.

Identifying outliers:
To identify outliers, we will start by visualizing the data using scatter plots or box plots. Outliers will be data points that are significantly different from the 
rest of the data points. Once outliers are identified, we will investigate why they exist and if they are due to data entry errors or actual anomalous situations.

Determining the fastest growing countries:
To determine the fastest growing countries, we will calculate the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for each country's food production and consumption between two 
reference periods, such as 2010-2013 and 2005-2010. We will then rank the countries based on their CAGR values.

Comparing food and feed consumption:
To compare food and feed consumption, we will calculate the ratio of feed to food for each food item and visualize the data using scatter plots or box plots. We will
also compare the ratios between different countries to see if there are any significant differences in the way they consume food and feed.

Note- Based on a preliminary analysis of the data and the modules learned in class, we have developed an initial set of outcomes from the data. As we conduct further
analysis, we will incorporate additional points into our analysis plan, which will be detailed in the final project report.

Motivation
The world population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, which has resulted in an increased focus on finding solutions for feeding the growing population. 
In response, food and agriculture organizations, entrepreneurs, and philanthropists are exploring various approaches, such as modifying our food production and 
consumption practices. To address this challenge, our team will conduct exploratory data analysis on the available data. The insights gleaned from this analysis can 
assist policymakers, food and agriculture organizations, and entrepreneurs in developing effective strategies for ensuring food security and sustainable agricultural 
practices.
